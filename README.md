# Sing_Song_Cook_Book_KOREAN
This will be an instructional guide to making Korean dishes from Sing Song.
Ranging from side dishes, soups, sauce & marinades, beverages and main dishes.
The intent is to document all the recipes and experiments for future events. 
Eventually this can be available for printed books for others to reference and create their own Korean cuisine.
Also, to experiment with a marketing approach with characters and other story elements to boost appeal.
